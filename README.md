# <img src="doc/cat.png" width="40"> ExLlamaV3 — ROCm / RDNA fork

This is a **ROCm fork of [ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3)** by turboderp, tracking
upstream v1.5.0. If you are on NVIDIA, you want [the upstream repo](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3) —
this one builds for CUDA too, but adds nothing there.

The Python package is still named `exllamav3`, so it is a drop-in replacement for code that imports it. For a
server, use the bundled one (see [Server](#server)).
Only the repository is renamed.

### What this fork changes

The CUDA kernels that cannot compile for RDNA are replaced with hand-written HIP/WMMA siblings under
`exllamav3_ext/rocm/`, reached through a compat shim and include-path redirection. Python divergences live in
`exllamav3/rocm_py/` and are applied as monkeypatches at import.

**No upstream C++ or CUDA source is modified — not one.** Verify it yourself:

```sh
git diff --stat v1.5.0 -- '*.cu' '*.cuh' '*.cpp' '*.h' ':(exclude)exllamav3/exllamav3_ext/rocm'
# (empty)
```

Outside `rocm/`, `rocm_py/` and `rocm_tools/`, five upstream code/README files differ from v1.5.0, alongside local validation documentation, plus one added file
(`requirements_rocm.txt`) and one ignore line in `.gitignore`:

| file | change |
|---|---|
| `setup.py` | ROCm backend selector and `hipcc` builder. All ROCm behaviour is inside `HIPBuildExtension`, so a CUDA build is untouched upstream code. |
| `exllamav3/__init__.py` | Six lines calling `rocm_py.apply()` at the end of package init. Returns immediately when `torch.version.hip` is `None`, so it is inert on CUDA. |
| `exllamav3/modules/attention_fn/bc_attn.py` | gfx1030 FP16 BC decode-attention tuning in `BCAttn._configure`: the GQA head tile narrows to the group size and the AOT decode signatures get verified `:16` alignment hints. Gated to HIP + gfx1030 + the validated decode shape family (provenance and the alignment contract: `rocm_py/gqa_decode_tune.py`); every other shape, device and build — CUDA included — keeps the original geometry and signatures. `EXL3_ROCM_GQA_TUNE=0` opts out. |
| `exllamav3/modules/attention_fn/triton_paged.py` | Selects the narrow-KV prefill tile explicitly on RDNA instead of relying on `get_device_capability()` accidentally reporting `(11, 5)`, plus measured notes on decode split counts. |
| `README.md` | This section. |

```sh
git diff --stat v1.5.0 -- . ':(exclude)exllamav3/exllamav3_ext/rocm' ':(exclude)exllamav3/rocm_py' ':(exclude)rocm_tools'
```

The table lists the upstream integration points; local validation documentation is under `doc/`.

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| ROCm | **7.2.4 or newer** — the build hard-fails below this |
| GPU | RDNA2 `gfx1030` (V620): experimental single-GPU support, validated on Qwen3-8B EXL3 4bpw and Qwen3-30B-A3B EXL3 3bpw. See [V620 results](doc/rdna2_phase2_results.md) for the tested mixed runtime and limits. RDNA3 / RDNA3.5: `gfx1100`, `gfx1101`, `gfx1102`, `gfx1150`, `gfx1151` — developed and validated on gfx1151. RDNA4 (`gfx1200`, `gfx1201`): experimental. R9700/gfx1201 needs a 64 KiB LDS build budget; its small cooperative GEMM still reaches an unimplemented WMMA trap. Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-30B-A3B were measured with explicit comparison adapters, including MLP range balancing and MoE prefill reconstruction. See [R9700 vs V620 results and workarounds](doc/r9700_vs_v620.md); this is not general unmodified RDNA4 model support. |
| Python | 3.10+ (whatever the ROCm torch index publishes a wheel for) |
| Torch | ROCm build, from `download.pytorch.org/whl/rocmX.Y` — see below |

You do **not** need FlashAttention. Upstream uses Triton paged attention, so the FA2 dependency that
earlier ROCm forks required is gone.

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CarouselAether/rocm_exl3
cd rocm_exl3

# 1. ROCm torch + triton-rocm + everything else.
#    Do NOT use requirements.txt on ROCm -- it resolves torch from PyPI, which is the CUDA build.
pip install -r requirements_rocm.txt

# 2. Build and install the extension against that torch.
pip install --no-build-isolation .
```

`--no-build-isolation` is required, not optional: pip otherwise builds in an isolated environment with no
torch in it, and a torch C++ extension has to be compiled against the same torch it will run against.
Building without it fails with an explanation rather than silently installing an empty package.

The build compiles ~117 sources with `hipcc` in parallel (`MAX_JOBS` to limit it, e.g. on a low-memory
machine).

### Tested

Developed on a Ryzen AI Max 395+ (Strix Halo, **gfx1151**, 128 GB unified) — Ubuntu 24.04, ROCm 7.2.4,
torch 2.13.0+rocm7.2, triton-rocm 3.7.1, Python 3.12. Verified end to end with GLM-4.6V (MoE, 3.55 bpw),
Gemma-4-31B (dense), DeepSeek-V4-Flash (DSA sparse attention, 2.04 bpw) and Qwen 3.8-Flash-Next
(QSA sparse attention + PLE n-gram embeddings + 512-expert MoE, 4 bpw). The other architectures in the
supported list above should work but are untested — reports welcome.

**v1.5.0 sync status (2026-09-20, validated on gfx1151):** the port was brought from v1.4.4 to v1.5.0 by
source-level merge — upstream's own diffs applied to the RDNA siblings, two siblings regenerated, two new
CUDA-only kernels stubbed. Validated end to end on gfx1151: full build, sibling drift audit, numeric ladder
(`mgemv_check`, `test_reconstruct_had`, `test_dsa_kernels` all PASS, pytest suites 161/161), and coherent
generation on the four models in the verified list — including Qwen 3.8-Flash-Next, the architecture this
sync targets. `exllamav3/exllamav3_ext/rocm/RDNA_NOTES.md` lists exactly what changed and what remains
unexercised (the opt-in gates below).

### Known limitations on ROCm

- **Tensor-parallel is not available.** The `parallel/` kernels are excluded from the ROCm build.
- **Vision/multimodal is untested.** Text generation is what has been verified.
- **MoE decode at bsz ≤ 8 runs the per-token `exl3_mgemm` route** (upstream's own v1.4.4 route, reinstated by
  `rocm_py`), not upstream v1.5.0's cooperative decode kernel (`exl3_moe_coop`, inline-PTX GEMV based, not ported).
  On RDNA each call lands on the mgemv fast path; Laguna-S-2.1 4bpw decodes at 21 t/s this way versus 10 through
  the fused `exl3_moe` kernel (`EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MGEMM_ROUTE=0` selects that steer). `EXL3_ROCM_MOE_BSZN=1` restores
  upstream dispatch and raises in the stub.
- **The one-launch sliced Q/K/V bundle is off by default** (`EXL3_ROCM_QKV_SLICE=1` to enable): the sliced mgemm
  mode is ported into the WMMA kernels but unvalidated on RDNA; the pairwise bundles from v1.4.4 are used.
- **RDNA4 (gfx1200/gfx1201) runs MoE through the per-expert path**: the fused MoE kernel's WMMA uses gfx11
  intrinsics that have no gfx12 encoding (LLVM cannot select them), so `rdna_wmma.hip.h` traps on gfx12 and
  `rocm_py` steers MoE off the fused kernel there. Dense models are unaffected. Compile-verified for gfx1201
  (`GPU_ARCH=gfx1201 rocm_tools/hipcc_probe.sh --all`); **never run on real RDNA4 hardware** — testers welcome.
  `EXL3_ROCM_RDNA4_FUSED_MOE=1` re-enables the fused route for a future gfx12 WMMA port.
- **MoE 32/64-row tiles fall back to the 16-row kernel** (same numerics; slower prefill on mul1 MoE models).
- **The batched expert-reconstruct tier is off by default** (`EXL3_ROCM_BATCH_RECON=1` to enable): ported
  mechanically, untested.
- **fp16-accumulate `hgemm` and the sm_120 quantizer specialisations are CUDA-only.** hipBLAS and the original
  quantizer kernels are used; nothing is lost on RDNA, which has no fp32-accumulate rate penalty.
- **The int8-activation GEMV is not ported** (a disabled stub); every call uses the fp16 GEMV/GEMM kernels.
- **HIP graph capture is off by default**: capture/replay corrupts BC decode across generator jobs and can hang at
  capture on ROCm 7.2.x. `EXL3_ROCM_HIP_GRAPHS=1` re-enables it for A/B against newer ROCm stacks.
- **Quantization (`convert.py`) is built but not yet exercised on RDNA.** Convert on CUDA if you can; reports welcome.
- Kernel behaviour can be bisected at runtime with the `EXL3_ROCM_*` environment switches — see
  `exllamav3/rocm_py/__init__.py`, whose module docstring lists each one and why it exists.

### Server

The fork ships its own server: `rocm_tools/exl3_server/server.py`, a single-file, llama.cpp-server-style,
OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. Its dependencies are in `requirements_rocm.txt`. It takes the same model/sampler
flags as `examples/chat.py` (they come from `exllamav3.model_init.add_args`), plus the server flags below.

```sh
python rocm_tools/exl3_server/server.py -m ~/models/<model>-exl3 -cs 32768 -ngram 2 -dds
# serves on http://127.0.0.1:3953
```

`-ngram 2 -dds` (n-gram drafting, skipped while acceptance is low) is the recommended speculative-decoding setting on
this GPU. Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /props`, `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions` (prompt built with the
model's own chat template), `POST /v1/completions` (prompt used verbatim, for clients that apply their own instruct
template), `POST /tokenize`, `POST /detokenize`. Streaming uses standard OpenAI SSE chunks ending in `data: [DONE]`.
Sampling flags set the *defaults*; each request can override them. See
[`rocm_tools/exl3_server/README.md`](rocm_tools/exl3_server/README.md) for endpoint details, SillyTavern setup and
measurements.

#### All flags

Every flag has a short and a long form; the short form is shown. Run `server.py -h` for the live list.

**Model loading**

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-m DIR` | model directory (required) |
| `-gs GB[,GB...]` | max VRAM to use per device, in GB; on a single-GPU Strix Halo box this is one number |
| `-lm` | print loader metrics |
| `-or FILE` | tensor override spec (YAML) |
| `-tp` | load in tensor-parallel mode (multi-GPU); respects `-gs` where it can |
| `-tpb native\|nccl` | tensor-parallel backend, default `native` |
| `-tp_attn N`, `-tp_mlp N`, `-tp_moe N`, `-tp_linear N`, `-tp_linear_attn N` | (TP) cap the parallelism of that layer class |
| `-tp_moe_ts` | (TP) tensor-split MoE layers instead of expert parallelism |
| `-swa_full` | use a full cache for sliding-window layers instead of recurrent mode with snapshots |
| `-ambs N` | max batch size to account for when autosplitting, default 4 |
| `-chunk_size N` | max prefill chunk size |
| `-lv` | verbose loading |
| `-asnf` | skip the forward pass during autosplit (debug) |
| `-layer_map SPEC` | RYS layer map, e.g. `0..15,11..31` repeats layers 11-15 once |

**MoE on the CPU** (experimental; layer-split mode only; needs mul1-codebook experts)

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-mcl N` | run the routed experts of the first N block-sparse MoE layers on the CPU, weights in system RAM |
| `-mcs N` | per-layer split: run the tail N routed experts of every eligible MoE layer on the CPU, overlapped with the GPU experts; dynamic hot/cold placement is on (`EXL3_MOE_CPU_SWAP=0` for static). Mutually exclusive with `-mcl` |
| `-mct N` | worker threads for the two above (default `EXL3_MOE_CPU_THREADS`, else half the cores) |
| `-ngr` | load a PLE model's n-gram embedding table fully into RAM (tens of GB) instead of streaming rows from disk per forward, e.g. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next |

**KV cache**

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-cs N` | total cache size in tokens. **Default = the model's max context**; long-context models advertise 256K-1M, so pass `-cs` (e.g. `-cs 32768`) or `-cq` to keep the cache sane |
| `-cq BITS` or `-cq K,V` | quantized cache, one bit width for both or separate K and V widths |
| `-cca A` | compand `a` value for the simulated cache, default 0 |
| `-ccs GB` | CPU second-tier cache size, GB |
| `-rcs GB` | recurrent-state second-tier cache size, GB |

**Speculative decoding**

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-dm DIR` | separate draft model, like llama.cpp's `--model-draft`; DFlash / EAGLE-3-style drafters load directly (e.g. `-dm ~/models/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash`) |
| `-mtp` | draft with the model's own MTP head (DeepSeek V4, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, ...); not with `-dm` |
| `-ndt N` | draft tokens per step (default: the draft model's own default, else 4) |
| `-ngram N` | n-gram drafting from repeats already in the context, minimum match length N; no extra model. `-ngram 2` is the cheap default |
| `-dds` | dynamic draft length: skip or shorten drafting while acceptance is low; `-ndt` becomes the ceiling |
| `-dc X` | confidence target for dynamic draft truncation, default 0.4 |
| `-dmcl N` | like `-mcl` for the draft model or MTP head (experimental) |

Draft acceptance is printed per request in the server log and returned in the native `timings` as
`draft_n` / `draft_n_accepted`.

**Sampling defaults** (per-request values override these)

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-temp X` | temperature, default 0.8 |
| `-temp_first` | apply temperature before truncation |
| `-repp X` | HF-style repetition penalty, 1 disables |
| `-presp X`, `-freqp X` | presence / frequency penalty, 0 disables |
| `-penr N` | range in tokens the penalties look back over, default 1024 (see the note below) |
| `-minp X` | min-P truncation, default 0.08, 0 disables |
| `-topk N` | top-K truncation, 0 disables |
| `-topp X` | top-P truncation, 1 disables |
| `-adaptive_target X`, `-adaptive_decay X` | Adaptive-P target (1 disables) and decay |
| `-xtcp X`, `-xtct X` | XTC probability (0 disables) and threshold (default 0.1) |
| `-drym X`, `-dryb X`, `-dryal N`, `-dryln N` | DRY multiplier (0 disables), base (1.75), allowed repeat length (2), scan range in tokens (-1 = whole context, 0 disables) |

Keep the penalty range bounded: unbounded frequency/presence penalties over a long context were the cause of the
"coherency cliff" around 8K tokens that was once blamed on the kernels.

**Server**

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `-host ADDR`, `-port N` | bind address and port, default `127.0.0.1:3953` |
| `-key KEY` | require this API key (`Authorization: Bearer` or `x-api-key` header) |
| `-smn NAME` | model name reported by the API, default: the model directory name |
| `-maxr N` | server-side cap on tokens per response, default: fill the remaining context |
| `-ctk JSON` | default chat-template kwargs, e.g. `'{"enable_thinking": false}'` |
| `-lw N`, `-lmr N` | loop detection: stop after a window of N tokens repeats `-lmr` times (default 3); `-lw 0` disables |

</p>

## Installation

Start by making sure you have the appropriate version of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed (CUDA 12.4 or later) since the Torch dependency is not automatically handled by `pip`. Then pick a method below:

> **ROCm:** see [Install](#install) at the top of this file. The methods below are upstream's CUDA
> instructions, kept for the CUDA path. There is no prebuilt ROCm wheel; building from source is the ROCm route.

### Prebuilt wheel · recommended

Pick a wheel from the [releases page](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3/releases), then e.g.:

```sh
pip install https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3/releases/download/v0.0.6/exllamav3-0.0.6+cu128.torch2.8.0-cp313-cp313-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Install from PyPI

```sh
pip install exllamav3
```
Note that the PyPI package does not contain a prebuilt extension and requires the CUDA toolkit and build prerequisites (i.e. VS Build Tools on Windows, gcc on Linux, `python-dev` headers etc.).

### Build from source

<details>
<summary>Source installation with uv or pip</summary>


`exllamav3` declares a minimum `torch` version (>= 2.6.0) and CUDA version (>= 12.4), but beyond that the user is free to select a version of `torch` that is compatible with their environment.

`torch` can be installed in three ways (from least to most effort):
1. **with `uv`, setting only `--extra cuXXX`** installs `torch` automatically with the specified CUDA version, `torch` version is selected by `uv` from compatible versions in the specific index associated with the chosen CUDA version (options 1 and 2)
2. **with `uv`, creating a thin project that depends on `exllamav3[cuXXX]` and pins a specific `torch` version** — like (1) but `torch` is pinned in the thin project's `pyproject.toml`, see [pinning a specific PyTorch version (optional)](#pinning-a-specific-pytorch-version-optional) for details
3. Manually with `uv pip` or `pip` (options 3 and 4)

The flavor extras (`--extra`) are `cu124`, `cu126`, `cu128`, `cu129`, `cu130`, and `cu132` — pick the one matching your installed CUDA build. Both `uv sync` and `pip install .` build the package in an isolated environment where your `torch` is not visible, so they install the extension sources and compile them at first import (JIT, a few minutes once per torch version). For a precompiled install run `pip install --no-build-isolation .` in an environment that already has `torch`, or use the release wheels. Selecting a flavor installs the matching CUDA build of `torch`.

**Option 1 — Working in the cloned repo directly (`uv sync`):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3
cd exllamav3
# (Optional) switch to dev branch for latest in-progress features
git checkout dev

uv venv
uv sync --extra cu130
# add --extra examples and/or --extra eval for those extra dependencies
```

**Option 2 — Using `exllamav3` as a dependency from another project (`uv add`):**

```sh
# `uv add` works inside an existing project (a directory with a pyproject.toml).
# `uv init` creates one if you're starting a new project, if integrating into
# an existing project skip `uv init`.
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# local checkout
uv add 'path/to/exllamav3[cu130]'               # non-editable
uv add 'path/to/exllamav3[cu130]' --editable    # editable

# straight from GitHub
uv add 'git+https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3.git[cu130]'                 # default branch
uv add 'git+https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3.git[cu130]' --branch dev    # specific branch
```

**Option 3 — Bring your own `torch` and let `uv` pick the backend automatically:**

```sh
uv venv            # or: uv venv --python-preference only-managed
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install torch --torch-backend=auto
uv pip install .
```

`--torch-backend=auto` inspects your system and installs the matching PyTorch CUDA build; see [Automatic backend selection](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/#automatic-backend-selection).

**Option 4 — With `pip`:**

On Windows, you also need the `triton-windows` package (declared as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`); the attention, cache and recurrent kernels are Triton and ExLlamaV3 does not import without it.

```sh
# install a CUDA-enabled torch first so it matches your setup, e.g.:
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install .
```

</details>

ROCm-specific build variables:
- `EXL3_BACKEND`: `cuda` or `rocm`, forcing the backend. Otherwise it follows the installed torch.
- `MAX_JOBS`: also honoured by the ROCm builder, which drives `hipcc` directly. It defaults to a value
  bounded by core count, RAM (~2.5 GB budgeted per job) and a cap of 32, so lower it if you still run out of memory.
- `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` / `GPU_ARCHS`: comma- or space-separated `gfx` list to build for (e.g. `gfx1100,gfx1151`;
  semicolons are *not* separators). An explicit value is used as-is. If unset, the build uses what `rocminfo`
  reports, filtered against the supported list. `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` takes precedence.
- LDS budget: not an environment variable. `setup.py` passes `-DEXL3_RDNA_SMEM_MAX` from the target archs
  (64 KB for Strix / Strix Halo and unknown targets, 90 KB for discrete RDNA3/4, the smallest across a multi-arch
  build), and at runtime it is further clamped to the device's `sharedMemPerBlock`.
- `EXL3_RDNA_MOE_TILESIZE_K`: `32` (default) or `16`. 16 forces the MoE GEMMs onto the single-K path — the
  tile geometry every RDNA shape is validated on — at a cost of roughly 1.4–1.6× MoE throughput. It is the
  first thing to try if fused MoE output ever looks wrong.
- `EXL3_SKIP_ROCM_VERSION_CHECK`: bypass the ROCm >= 7.2.4 requirement. Not advised — older ROCm builds this
  extension successfully and then computes wrong results.

<details>
<summary>Pinning a specific PyTorch version (optional)</summary>

#### Pinning a specific PyTorch version (optional)

The flavor extra picks the *index*, but by default torch resolves to the latest version on that
index that satisfies `>=2.6.0`. To pin a specific torch version while developing on `exllamav3`,
create a **"thin" project** that consumes your local checkout as an editable install and declares
the exact `torch` version itself. This keeps the pin out of the `exllamav3` pyproject, so
you can change the torch version freely without touching the repo.

```
my-exllamav3-dev/          # thin project (uv init)
├── pyproject.toml
└── src/                  # package sources (auto-generated)
```

In `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-exllamav3-dev"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Dev environment for exllamav3"
requires-python = ">=3.10.11"
dependencies = [
    "exllamav3[cu130]",   # select correct CUDA version
    "torch==2.13.0",      # pin the exact torch version you need
]

[tool.uv.sources]
exllamav3 = { path = "../exllamav3", editable = true }
```

Adjust `../exllamav3` to point at your local checkout, then a plain `uv sync` sets up an
environment with the correct PyTorch index (routed via the `cuXXX` extra),
the pinned version of `torch` from that index (as long as it exists), and an editable install of `exllamav3` so code
changes apply immediately. Switch CUDA flavors by changing the extra (`exllamav3[cu124]`,
`exllamav3[cu128]`, …) and/or the torch pin in the thin project.

Or, if you're installing torch manually with `uv pip install torch` (e.g. as in Option 3 above),
specify the version directly, e.g. `uv pip install "torch==2.11.0" --torch-backend=auto`.

</details>

After installing with one of the options above, you should be able to run the conversion, eval and 
example scripts from the main repo directory, e.g., `uv run python convert.py -i ...` or, for manual
installations once the venv is active, `python convert.py -i ...`

**Build environment variables**

- `MAX_JOBS`: by default ninja may launch too many processes and run out of system memory for 
compilation. Set this to a reasonable value like 4 in that case.
- `EXLLAMA_NOCOMPILE`: set to install the library without compiling the C++/CUDA extension. Torch
will build/load it at runtime instead.

## Examples

A number of example scripts are provided to showcase the features of the backend and generator. 
For instance, a versatile CLI chatbot:

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/chatpy.png" width="640" alt="Llama 3.1 8B Instruct quantization benchmark across bits per weight">
</p>

```sh
python examples/chat.py -m <input_dir> -mode <prompt_mode>

# Wealth of options
python examples/chat.py -h
```

## Conversion

To convert a model to EXL3 format, use:

```sh
# Convert model
python convert.py -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir> -w <working_dir> -b <bitrate>

# Resume an interrupted quant job
python convert.py -w <working_dir> -r

# More options
python convert.py -h
```

The working directory is temporary storage for state checkpoints and for storing quantized tensors 
until the converted model can be compiled. It should have enough free space to store an entire copy 
of the output model.

See the [conversion guide](doc/convert.md) for more information, or the 
[self-calibration guide](doc/optimize.md). 

## EXL3 quantization

EXL3 quantization is a streamlined variant of [**QTIP**](https://github.com/Cornell-RelaxML/qtip) from Cornell RelaxML. It aims to make
SOTA quantization available to users on consumer hardware. The conversion process is designed to be
simple and efficient and requires only an input model (in HF format) and a target bitrate. By
computing Hessians on the fly and thanks to a fused Viterbi kernel, the quantizer can convert a 
model in a single step, taking a couple of minutes for smaller models, up to a few hours for larger
ones (70B+) on a single high-end consumer GPU (see the [conversion guide](doc/convert.md)).

For more information, see the [**QTIP**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11235) and [**QuIP#**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04396) papers, as well as this 
[excellent writeup](https://www.together.ai/blog/even-better-even-faster-quantized-llms-with-qtip) on **QTIP** from together.ai.
