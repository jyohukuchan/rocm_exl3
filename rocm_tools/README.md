# rocm_tools

Verification and measurement tools for the ROCm backend. They exist so the port's conclusions can be re-checked after a ROCm bump or on a
different RDNA card, rather than trusted.

All scripts resolve paths relative to the repo, use the active virtualenv's
torch, and detect the GPU via `rocminfo`. Nothing is hardcoded to one machine.

## `hipcc_probe.sh`

Compiles `exllamav3_ext` sources with the ROCm shim, using the same flags
`setup.py`'s `HIPBuildExtension` will. Much faster than a full build for
iterating on shim gaps.

```bash
rocm_tools/hipcc_probe.sh norm.cu        # one file
rocm_tools/hipcc_probe.sh --all          # all ROCm-built sources
GPU_ARCH=gfx1100 rocm_tools/hipcc_probe.sh --all   # another card
```

Current baseline on gfx1151 / ROCm 7.2.4: **all 117 ROCm-built sources pass**
(`GPU_ARCH=gfx1201` also compiles clean). The inline-PTX files are excluded, in
step with `ROCM_EXCLUDE` in `setup.py`. Any failure after a toolchain change
means the shim needs attention.

## `r9700_preflight.py`

Read-only pre-build environment diagnostic for the R9700 (gfx1201): torch/HIP
versions, device arch / 64 KiB LDS facts, build-target and fused-MoE env checks.
It diagnoses the environment; it does not prove inference works. Usage and the
JSON snapshot schema: [`../doc/r9700_preflight.md`](../doc/r9700_preflight.md).

```bash
python3 rocm_tools/r9700_preflight.py --json   # live query (lazy torch import)
```

## `attn_check.py`

Checks upstream's in-tree Triton paged attention against an independent fp32
reference across decode/prefill/longq/paged, MHA and GQA, batched, head_dim
64/128/256.

```bash
python rocm_tools/attn_check.py
```

This is the gate that made the port viable: it establishes that FlashAttention
is not required, because upstream's own Triton kernels are numerically correct on
RDNA. Expected: **18/18**, max abs error ~1e-5 (fp16 rounding). Deliberately does
not import the compiled extension, so it runs before any kernel work.

## `bench_prefill_tiles.py`

Measures prefill throughput for the "Blackwell" tile config against the intended
non-Blackwell one.

```bash
python rocm_tools/bench_prefill_tiles.py
```

Kept to re-verify the RDNA tile choice. Upstream's `triton_paged.py` selects
tiles from `get_device_capability()[0] >= 10`, which gfx1151 trips by accident
(it reports `(11, 5)`); this fork now selects the narrow-kv tile explicitly on
ROCm. The measured result is counter-intuitive and worth re-checking on new
hardware: the narrow-kv config is *faster* on RDNA, because upstream sizes tiles
for ~100 KB of smem and RDNA 3.5 has 64 KB of LDS.

## `mgemv_bitwise.py` and `decode_bitwise.py`

Bitwise A/B across a code change, for changes whose arithmetic is claimed to
be identical (the 2026-09 launch-count fusions). Each runs twice: `--save
ref.pt` on the build before the change, `--compare ref.pt` on the build after
it, and fails on any differing bit.

```bash
python rocm_tools/mgemv_bitwise.py  -m /path/to/moe-model --save ref.pt    # old build
python rocm_tools/mgemv_bitwise.py  -m /path/to/moe-model --compare ref.pt # new build
python rocm_tools/decode_bitwise.py -m /path/to/model --save ref.pt
python rocm_tools/decode_bitwise.py -m /path/to/model --compare ref.pt
```

`mgemv_bitwise.py` drives the multi-matrix GEMV (`exl3_mgemv_rdna.hip`)
directly, over the same routing configurations `mgemv_check.py` covers.
`decode_bitwise.py` greedy-decodes a fixed prompt and records every step's
logits, which is the only way to reach the single-matrix graph GEMV path (it
runs inside the BC modules, which no binding exposes). A tolerance check
cannot tell a pure refactor from a few-ulp change; these can.

## Re-verifying after a ROCm upgrade

ROCm changed substantially between 7.1 and 7.2 — several workarounds in the
original fork became unnecessary, and at least one intrinsic changed
availability. Assume nothing carries over:

```bash
rocm_tools/hipcc_probe.sh --all          # shim still complete?
python rocm_tools/attn_check.py   # attention still correct?
python rocm_tools/bench_prefill_tiles.py # tile choice still right?
```

Anything in `exllamav3_ext/rocm/hip_compat.hip.h` commented as "absent from HIP"
should be re-grepped against `$ROCM_PATH/include` and deleted if HIP has since
grown it.

## `bench_decode_splits.py`

Sweeps decode split-K against the shipped heuristic.

```bash
python rocm_tools/bench_decode_splits.py
```

Exists because `multi_processor_count` reports WGPs on ROCm rather than CUs
(gfx1151: 20 for a 40-CU part), so the split target is half what the same code
assumes on NVIDIA. Doubling it was tried and reverted — the apparent 6-7% gain
did not survive repeat measurement. Kept so the question can be re-answered on
parts with a different CU count or CU/WGP ratio.

## On measurement noise

The decode step has a **4.7% run-to-run spread** (1.6% stdev over 8 repeats) on
gfx1151, with the first measurement reading high as clocks ramp. Anything under
~5% needs repeating before it means anything — one apparent decode win in this
port evaporated under that test, while the prefill tile result held at ~12%
across three runs with under 1% spread.

Both benchmarks are cheap. Run them several times before acting on a result.

## Hardware and kernel notes

The measured facts these tools exist to protect — WMMA operand order and fragment
layout, `sudot4` vs `sdot4`, the 64 KB LDS budget, the noise floor, and why each
RDNA sibling differs from the upstream file it replaces — are in
[`exllamav3/exllamav3_ext/rocm/RDNA_NOTES.md`](../exllamav3/exllamav3_ext/rocm/RDNA_NOTES.md).
Its "Verification tools" table covers every script here, not just the four above.

[ROCM_PORT_MAP.md](ROCM_PORT_MAP.md) is the original porting log. Its pass counts
(31 / 43 of 50) are historical; the current baseline is above.
