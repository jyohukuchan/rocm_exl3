"""ROCm/RDNA Python-side overrides for exllamav3.

The C++ side keeps upstream sources byte-identical and puts every ROCm-specific
change in ``exllamav3_ext/rocm/`` as a sibling file (see that directory's
README). This package is the same idea for Python: instead of editing upstream
modules in place, the divergences live here and are applied as monkeypatches at
import time, from a single hook at the end of ``exllamav3/__init__.py``.

Why not edit the modules directly? The original ROCm fork did, across five
files, and every upstream rebase then had to re-derive which edits were ROCm
workarounds and which were upstream changes. Keeping them here means
``git diff`` against upstream stays empty for the shared code, and each
divergence carries its own reason and its own off switch.

A patch that cannot be applied reports "!! FAILED" in describe() rather than
being swallowed. A bisect handle that silently does nothing is worse than no
handle at all -- it makes a live kernel look disabled.

Nothing here runs unless ``torch.version.hip`` is set, so a CUDA build imports
this module and does nothing.

Environment switches (all default to the safe value for this backend):

  EXL3_ROCM_PATCH=0        disable every patch below
  EXL3_ROCM_MGEMM=0        distrust exl3_mgemm on RDNA: disables MultiLinear
                           fusion *and* the bsz-1 MoE mgemm routes. Default on
                           since 2026-08-07 (see the note at the patch)
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_DISABLE=1  route block-sparse MoE through the dense per-expert
                           path instead of the fused kernel (NOT advised -- see
                           the note at the patch itself)
  EXL3_ROCM_MLP_RANGE_BALANCE=0  on gfx1030, do not rescale gated-MLP up/down
                           svh metadata (up /= 8, down *= 8) at forward entry
                           to keep silu(g)*u inside fp16 range (d-reference:
                           3/8 cases -> Inf; the Model.load-wrapping prototype
                           restored full finiteness at 94.63% top-1 vs native
                           BF16 -- GPU verification of this guard is pending
                           via rocm_tools/rdna2/mlp_range_balance_probe.py)
  EXL3_ROCM_RDNA4_FUSED_MOE=1  on gfx120x, do not steer MoE off the fused
                           kernel (whose WMMA traps on gfx12); for a future
                           gfx12 WMMA port

  Bisect handles -- slow, for localising a numerics fault, never to leave on:

  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_TORCH=1    MoE expert compute in pure torch
  EXL3_ROCM_ROUTING_TORCH=1  expert routing in pure torch (routing_ds3)
  EXL3_ROCM_FORCE_TORCH=1  every EXL3 Linear via reconstruct + at::mm, taking
                           exl3_gemm and exl3_gemv out of the model

  Added at the v1.5.0 sync (2026-09-20). Each keeps a v1.4.4-validated path as
  the default and makes the new upstream path opt-in until it has been run on
  RDNA:

  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_BSZN=1     let bsz <= MAX_BSZN MoE decode take upstream's
                           BC_BlockSparseMLP.run_bszN route. On ROCm that route
                           is the unported exl3_moe_coop kernel and raises;
                           default off steers it (see the next switch)
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MGEMM_ROUTE=0  steer bsz <= MAX_BSZN MoE decode to the fused
                           exl3_moe kernel (a 16-row tile GEMM padding one
                           useful row: ~half the decode speed). Default on =
                           the restored v1.4.4 per-token exl3_mgemm route,
                           which lands on the mgemv fast path
  EXL3_ROCM_QKV_SLICE=1    enable the one-launch sliced Q/K/V bundle
                           (SlicedMultiLinear, exl3_mgemm sliced mode). Ported
                           into the WMMA kernels, unvalidated on RDNA
  EXL3_ROCM_BATCH_RECON=1  enable the batched expert-reconstruct prefill tier
                           (reconstruct_*_batch + hgemm_batched). Ported
                           mechanically, unvalidated on RDNA
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MTILE=1    let Python split fused-MoE launches into 16/32/64-row
                           tiers. Pointless on RDNA, which only builds the
                           16-row instance and runs every tier through it

These are bisect handles, not permanent policy -- turn one on, run a prompt, see
whether the output degrades. Each one's justification is a measurement recorded
at the patch, not an inherited assumption; a guard whose reason has gone stale
is a guard that should be retested and deleted.

    #     fused_mode_buffers are already built (all four are computed inside
    #     load_local, gated on support_quant_paths *at load time*).

    # graph launches with exl3_moe_coop, a fused decode kernel built on
    # exl3_gemv_kernel.cuh (PTX mma + cp.async). It has no RDNA sibling; the
    # ROCm build links a stub that raises if reached (rocm/quant/
    # exl3_moe_coop_rdna.hip). block_sparse_mlp.forward takes that route
    # whenever `self.bc is not None and bsz <= MAX_BSZN`, and its else-branch
    # asserts bszn_eligible, so the dispatch has to be steered from outside.
    #
    # Two steers exist. The default restores upstream's own v1.4.4 route,
    # verbatim: per token, gate and up through exl3_mgemm (indices = that
    # token's experts), the activation, then down through exl3_mgemm with the
    # routing weights, which reduces the top-k expert outputs into out_d[0].
    # That row is the token's routed sum and is copied to out_bszn[i], where
    # the branch reads it back. Every call is num_tokens == 1, so on RDNA each
    # lands on the mgemv fast path (exl3_mgemv_rdna.hip: barrier-free dot
    # core, 120-240 GB/s). Measured 2026-09-22 on Laguna-S-2.1 4bpw
    # (bench_model.py): the fused steer decodes at 10.4 t/s, v1.4.4 on this
    # route at 20.8 -- the fused exl3_moe is a 16-row WMMA tile GEMM that pads
    # one useful row to sixteen and runs at a flat ~53 GB/s (RDNA_NOTES.md,
    # "Token generation was NOT memory-bound as first shipped").
    #
    # Mechanics: forward is wrapped so that, for the duration of the call,
    # self.bc is a proxy whose run_bszN is the Python loop below; every other
    # attribute forwards to the real BC_BlockSparseMLP, so bszn_eligible still
    # sees a non-None bc and the per-expert graph paths (bsz > MAX_BSZN) still
    # reach the C++ object. Shared experts: upstream's kernel merges them in-
    # kernel and the forward tail skips them while self.bc_sh_exp is True, so
    # bc_sh_exp is forced False after load_local and the tail's Python
    # shared-expert path runs instead, as it does for every non-bszN tier.
    # Expert-range shards pass cfg.min_expert / max_expert exactly as
    # run_bszN does (num_tokens == 1 compacts out-of-range picks).
    #
    # EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MGEMM_ROUTE=0 selects the older steer: MAX_BSZN is zeroed
    # for the call and f_threshold set to 1, so bsz 1..8 runs the fused
    # exl3_moe kernel (correct per the 2026-08-08 fp32 comparison, half the
